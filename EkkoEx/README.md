# EkkoEx

This is a more improved version of my original [Ekko](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Ekko) project. 
Fixing some issues and flaws with it since I noticed that people were just are copy and pasting the code. 
You gotta add some functions to the Cfg exception list or you get fucked by CFG lol. 
Anyway, you are going to notice it when you try to inject it into Explorer.exe since it has Control Flow Guard enabled. 

### Note 
This time don't just copy and paste code. 
I don't have anything against copy and pasting but at least try to fix known issues or modify it. 
Maybe this code is flawed too who knows hehe.
It can be improved to add more safety stuff it to (Cfg, Stack spoofing, Heap Encryption, etc.)
